The purpose of this repository is to learn new languages, using the Advent of Code event that occurs every year since
2015. I am starting with the 2015 problems today, using Java, I'll try to use a different programming language for
every year

I made it public so that recruiters/colleagues can see how bad of a coder I am.

Enjoy.
